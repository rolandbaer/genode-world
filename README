          ==========================================================
          A collection of community-maintained components for Genode
          ==========================================================

This repository hosts Genode components that do not fall in the narrow scope of
the Genode OS Framework (https://genode.org), like ported applications,
libraries and community-maintained components that reside outside of the base
framework.

Now, clone the _genode-world.git_ repository to a place of your choosing:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-world.git

In its current iteration the various Goa projects are losely categorized
by top-level directories that roughly define which type of software is to
expected inside, e.g. 'database' contains a port of sqlite3.

The notable exceptions are the 'legacy' and 'pkgs' directories:

* :legacy: contains the content of the original _genode-world_ repository
  and is going to be removed eventually

* :pkgs: contains pkg archives that accumlate all dependencies for a given
  component version. Those dependencies may be more volatile than the actual
  component version, e.g. the sqlite3 version does not change and neither
  does the API version of the libc but the version of the libc library
  implementing the API changes.


Note of caution
---------------

In contrast to the components found in the mainline Genode repository, the
components within the _world_ repository are not subjected to the regular
quality-assurance measures of Genode Labs. Hence, problems are to be expected.
If you encounter bugs, build problems, or stability issues, please report them
to the issue tracker [1] or the Genode mailing list [2].

Note considering the old genode-world repository
------------------------------------------------

The old content of the Genode world repository is available in the 'legacy'
sub-directory for a finite time.

It is currently in a transition phase to become a Goa projects focal point.
The original _genode-world_ content can be found in the _legacy_ sub-directory
for the time being and to keep it operable you may have to replace your current
repository checkout.

Replace the'repos/world' directory with a symlink pointing to your checkout and
in case you followed the original _README_ file it is safe to move your direct
checkout directory out of Genode's _repos_ directory, .e.g.

! mv genode/repos/world ../genode-world
! ln -sf <path>/genode-world/legacy genode/repos/world

Afterwards the repository can be used as before.
