          ==========================================================
          A collection of community-maintained components for Genode
          ==========================================================

This repository hosts Genode components that do not fall in the narrow scope of
the Genode OS Framework (https://genode.org), e.g., ported applications,
libraries, and games.

It is currently in a transition phase to become a Goa projects focal point.
The original _genode-world_ content can be found in the _legacy_ sub-directory
for the time being and to keep it operable you may have to replace your current
repository checkout.

Replace the'repos/world' directory with a symlink pointing to your checkout and
in case you followed the original _README_ file it is safe to move your direct
checkout directory out of Genode's _repos_ directory, .e.g.

! mv genode/repos/world ../genode-world
! ln -sf <path>/genode-world/legacy genode/repos/world

Afterwards the repository can be used as before.
